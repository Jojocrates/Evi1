# Halcon Web Application

This project is a web application for "Halcon", a construction materials distributor. The app helps manage customer orders and internal processes like sales, purchasing, warehouse, and delivery.

## Features

- Customers can check their order status.
- Admin can register users and assign roles.
- Staff can update order status and upload delivery photos.
- Orders follow a full lifecycle: Ordered → In Process → In Route → Delivered.
- Deleted orders can be restored.

## Project Setup

This repository contains:
- UML diagrams (BPMN, Use Case, Activity, Class, ER)
- Documentation
- Project planning files

## Methodology

I chose **Extreme Programming (XP)** as the methodology for this project. XP emphasizes rapid iterations, continuous feedback, and small, manageable development cycles. This approach fits well with my current situation because I was unable to use my computer for two months due to surgery and now have limited time. XP allows me to deliver quality work in incremental steps while adapting to time constraints.
